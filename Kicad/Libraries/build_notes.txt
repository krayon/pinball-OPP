In the following instructions replace xxxxxx with the project name.  For example, if
the project name is application, the project file for Kicad is application.pro.

1.  Create a directory that will contain the library parts.  It should be stored in a
directory at ..\Libraries.  Highlight the directory, right-click,TortoiseSVN->Export.
Under URL of repository:
Choose http://eng-svn/svn/Eng/Projects/002XX_ApplicationSW/00206_KicadLibrary/rev/revxx.yy.zz
that matches the parts libary revision listed in the table.  This extracts all the files from
the repository.
