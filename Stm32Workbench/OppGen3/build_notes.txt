Note:  Include paths seem to have absolute paths to plugin tools such as:
/home/hugh-opp/Ac6/SystemWorkbench/plugins/fr.ac6.mcu.externaltools.arm-none.linux64_1.17.0.201812190825/tools/compiler/arm-none-eabi/include.  These paths will need to be altered depending on where eclipse installed plugins.
