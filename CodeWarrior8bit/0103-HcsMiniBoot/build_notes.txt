In the following instructions replace xxxxxx with the project name.  For example, if
the project name is application, the project file for CodeWarrior is application.mcp.

1.  Create a directory that is going to contain the bootloader files.

2.  Highlight the directory, right-click,TortoiseSVN->Export.  Under URL of repository:
Choose https://open-pinball-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/CodeWarrior8bit/0103-HcsMiniBoot
This extracts all the files from the repository.

3.  Run build.bat to create the S-record files for the three sizes of flash in the
processor.  The batch file also copies the output files to the bin directory, and
runs HexMerge.exe to output the CRC32 of the boot code.

!!! Only needs to be done if developing/debugging the bootloader  !!!

4.  Start CodeWarrior IDE

5.  Under File->Open... Browse to the directory and choose Bootload.mcp

6.  Under Edit->Standard Settings..., choose Target, Assembler for HC08 panel.  In
the Command Line Arguments text box fill out the APP_START_ADDR as needed.

Flash Size	APP_START_ADDR	RAM_END		Output File
8K		$e000 or 57344	$27f or 639	HCS08MiniBoot.asm.8k.sx
16K		$c000 or 49152	$46f or 1135	HCS08MiniBoot.asm.16k.sx
32K		$8000 or 32768	$46f or 1135	HCS08MiniBoot.asm.32k.sx

7.  Project->Make

8.  The assembler will output a file called bootload.asm.sx in the
"project\poject_data\Standard\ObjectCode" directory.

Bootloader Rev		Svn Rev		Flash Size		CRC32
"Boot0.0\r"	    	0.00.01 	32K			0x8fde0bfa
		                  	16K			0x8875524f
		                  	8K			0xcff7d90b
