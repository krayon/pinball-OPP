In the following instructions replace xxxxxx with the project name.  For example, if
the project name is application, the project file for CodeWarrior is application.mcp.

1.  Create a directory that is going to contain the application files.

2.  Highlight the directory, right-click,TortoiseSVN->Export.  Under URL of repository:
Choose https://open-pinball-project.googlecode.com/svn/tag/tagxx.yy.xx/CodeWarrior8bit/1003-InpDrv
where xx is major revision, yy is minor revision, and zz is engineering revision.
This extracts all the files from the repository.

3.  Browse to the MiniBoot repository,
https://open-pinball-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/CodeWarrior8bit/0103-HcsMiniBoot/bin/HCS08MiniBoot.asm.8k.sx
Save Link As... and save it into the xxxxxx\bin directory that was just created.

4.  If HexMerge.exe isn't installed, browse to the subversion repository,
https://open-pinball-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Eclipse/0202-HexMerge/Debug/HexMerge.exe
(right-click) Save Link As... and save it into the c:\WINDOWS\system32.  Rev 1.2 is the current version.

5.  Start CodeWarrior IDE

6.  Under File->Open... Browse to the directory and choose xxxxxx.mcp

7.  Project->Make

8.  The linker will output a file called xxxxxx.sx in the "project\bin" directory.

9.  Open a command prompt and change the directory to the project directory.

10. Run "build.bat".  This will create "xxxxxxBoot.sx which contains the bootloader
and the application code, and "xxxxxxUpgrade.sx" which contains S records for upgrading
a input controller.
